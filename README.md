This code package provides a powerful python-based multithreaded secondary spectrum analysis suite. The Secondary class needs only to be fed a FITS data filename, and will generate primary and secondary spectra that can be used for qualitative results. Multiple utility functions are built in, and most are multithreaded for maximum processing throughput.
